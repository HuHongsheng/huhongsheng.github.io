Abstract:
<br/> &#12288; The concept of Coxeter groups originates from groups generated by reflections. In this talk we will introduce this notion by presenting examples. Later, reflection representations of Coxeter groups will be classified. If time permits, we will talk about their relationship with Kazhdan-Lusztig theory and infinite dimensional representations.
